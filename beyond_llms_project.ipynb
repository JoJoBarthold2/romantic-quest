    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Feel free to read the books I provide in this repo. Some part are definitely fun. The covers look great too and the text is almost always faithfully generated. \n",
    "The text quality is okay, but its not really a long book. Increasing the length of the book and stopping repetitions are the most difficult part of this.\n",
    "I have submitted some books to Amazon. However since approving books can take time, I cannot say wether the books are actually bought by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A book can be relatively expensive especially with Claude Sonnet , where it costs about more then 4 dollars per book and is also very slow. I would not recommend Claude.\n",
    "Gemini is significantly cheaper with less around 1 dollar per book, especially when using the flash variant.\n",
    "Also generating a book can take a long time,  more then 30 minutes, which can affect rate limits. Also, most APIs are not robust  and  sometimes fail in generating something, so often you have to try again and waste ressources.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say that the chances of these books selling are relatively low, but I will try anyway.What nice is that I also generate a description right away and it looks good\n",
