      "Outline: {'title': 'Autumn in Reutlingen', 'chapters': [{'title': 'Chapter 1: The Double-Take', 'description': {'part_1': \"Exposition: Valentin sits in his usual spot in the back row of Professor Weber's advanced mathematics seminar, another monotonous Tuesday morning in his engineering program. He observes his classmates - the same faces he's seen for two years, all blending into a sea of predictable mediocrity. Rising Action: The classroom door opens ten minutes late, and Polina enters with an apologetic smile that doesn't quite hide her confidence. Her dark red hair cascades over a vintage black leather jacket, silver jewelry catching the fluorescent lights. Valentin watches as literally every head in the lecture hall turns to stare. Climax: When Polina scans the room for an empty seat, her brown eyes briefly lock with Valentin's blue ones behind his wire-rimmed glasses, and for a moment that feels eternal, she doesn't look away.\", 'part_2': \"Falling Action: Polina chooses the empty seat two rows in front of Valentin, and he spends the entire lecture studying the way she takes notes with a fountain pen, her handwriting flowing in elegant curves. He notices how she occasionally tucks a strand of red hair behind her ear when concentrating, and how she seems completely unbothered by the continued glances from other students. Resolution: As class ends and students file out, Valentin gathers his courage to introduce himself, but Polina has already disappeared into the crowd. He's left holding his breath, replaying that moment of eye contact and wondering if he imagined the small smile that seemed meant just for him. The ordinary Tuesday has become extraordinary, and Valentin realizes his carefully structured world has just been beautifully disrupted.\"}}, {'title': 'Chapter 2: Stammering and Statistics', 'description': {'part_1': \"Exposition: A week passes with Valentin strategically arriving early to mathematics seminars, hoping to catch Polina before class. He rehearses conversation starters in his head, everything from academic topics to casual observations about Reutlingen's autumn weather. Rising Action: When Polina arrives precisely on time again, she notices Valentin's obvious attempts to make eye contact and approaches him with an amused expression. She asks if he can explain the previous week's probability theory assignment, claiming she missed some key points. Climax: Valentin launches into an enthusiastic but increasingly nervous explanation, his words tumbling over each other as he tries to impress her with his mathematical knowledge while simultaneously being distracted by her proximity and the faint scent of her perfume - something mysterious and distinctly un-German.\", 'part_2': \"Falling Action: Instead of being put off by his stammering, Polina laughs - not mockingly, but with genuine delight. She tells him in her slightly accented English that his passion for mathematics is 'adorable' and asks if he'd be willing to study together sometime. Valentin, shocked by this turn of events, manages to suggest the university library. Resolution: They make plans to meet Thursday evening at the library's quiet study section. As Polina walks away, she turns back to say his name - which she somehow learned without him telling her - and Valentin realizes he's been holding his breath again. He spends the rest of the lecture in a daze, barely registering Professor Weber's discourse on statistical distributions while replaying the sound of his name in Polina's voice.\"}}, {'title': 'Chapter 3: Library Whispers', 'description': {'part_1': \"Exposition: Valentin arrives at the university library thirty minutes early, choosing a table with good lighting and arranging his materials with Germanic precision. He second-guesses everything from his choice of sweater (a soft gray that doesn't clash with his glasses) to whether bringing two different colored pens makes him look obsessive. Rising Action: Polina arrives fashionably late, her gothic aesthetic somehow perfectly suited to the library's ancient wooden shelves and dim lighting. She's carrying a worn leather satchel and a thermos of something that smells like chai spices. Climax: What begins as a mathematics study session quickly evolves into something deeper as Polina asks Valentin about his engineering dreams, and he finds himself sharing his secret passion for sustainable architecture - something he's never told his classmates who see engineering as merely a practical career choice.\", 'part_2': \"Falling Action: Polina reveals her own unexpected depth, discussing her literature studies and her fascination with German Romantic poetry, quoting Rilke in perfect German that makes Valentin's heart skip. She explains how mathematics appeals to her because of its universal language that transcends cultural boundaries. Resolution: As the library begins to empty and closing time approaches, they realize they've spent four hours talking about everything except the statistics assignment they originally planned to study. Walking out together into the crisp October evening, Polina suggests they continue their 'study session' at a café she's discovered in Reutlingen's old town, and Valentin agrees with an enthusiasm that surprises them both.\"}}, {'title': 'Chapter 4: Coffee and Philosophy', 'description': {'part_1': \"Exposition: Café Zeitgeist turns out to be a tiny, dimly lit establishment tucked between a vintage bookstore and an antique shop, exactly the kind of place Valentin would never have discovered on his own. The walls are covered with local artwork, and jazz music plays softly in the background. Rising Action: Over steaming mugs of coffee that Polina orders in fluent German (apparently she's been teaching herself), they dive into discussions about philosophy, art, and the meaning of home. Valentin learns that Polina has been in Germany for eight months, initially feeling like an outsider but gradually finding her place. Climax: When Polina asks Valentin about his own sense of belonging, he surprises himself by admitting that despite being born in Germany, he's always felt like an observer of life rather than a participant - until recently, he adds, looking directly at her with unprecedented boldness.\", 'part_2': \"Falling Action: The conversation shifts to lighter topics as Polina demonstrates her unexpected sense of humor, making witty observations about German cultural quirks that have Valentin laughing harder than he has in months. She teases him gently about his methodical note-taking habits and his tendency to adjust his glasses when thinking deeply. Resolution: When the café owner politely announces closing time, Valentin and Polina realize they've been the last customers for over an hour. Walking slowly back toward the university district, neither wanting the evening to end, they discover they live only a few streets apart. Polina suggests they should make this a weekly tradition - 'for academic purposes, of course' - and Valentin agrees while privately wondering if this incredible girl might actually be interested in spending time with him.\"}}, {'title': 'Chapter 5: Unexpected Courage', 'description': {'part_1': \"Exposition: Three weeks into their regular study-café routine, Valentin finds himself thinking about Polina constantly between their meetings. He catches himself daydreaming during lectures, sketching architectural designs inspired by her descriptions of Ukrainian art, and rehearsing conversations that never go according to plan. Rising Action: During their Thursday evening at Café Zeitgeist, Polina mentions wanting to attend a foreign film screening at Reutlingen's small independent cinema but being hesitant to go alone. Valentin recognizes this as a potential invitation but struggles with his usual self-doubt about whether someone as sophisticated as Polina would want him as a companion for something so culturally refined. Climax: Fighting against every insecure instinct, Valentin takes a deep breath and asks if she'd like company for the film screening, his heart pounding so loudly he's certain she can hear it over the café's ambient jazz music.\", 'part_2': \"Falling Action: Polina's face lights up with genuine pleasure at his invitation, and she admits she was hoping he'd ask but didn't want to be presumptuous about his interest in foreign cinema. She reveals that the film is actually a Ukrainian movie with German subtitles - something deeply personal she wants to share.

She says yes to all of it: the house, the future, and the unspoken proposal embedded in his grand gesture. Resolution: The book concludes with a flash-forward to five years later, showing Valentin and Polina in their completed home, hosting a dinner party that includes their Ukrainian and German friends, Professor Weber (who performed their wedding ceremony), and Valentin's parents. As Valentin watches Polina laugh with their guests, he reflects on how his life became extraordinary not through dramatic changes but through the simple, revolutionary act of falling in love with the right person. The final lines emphasize that some love stories aren't about conquering obstacles but about two people choosing each other every day and building something beautiful together.\"}}]}\n",

He observes his classmates - the same faces he's seen for two years, all blending into a sea of predictable mediocrity. Rising Action: The classroom door opens ten minutes late, and Polina enters with an apologetic smile that doesn't quite hide her confidence. Her dark red hair cascades over a vintage black leather jacket, silver jewelry catching the fluorescent lights. Valentin watches as literally every head in the lecture hall turns to stare. Climax: When Polina scans the room for an empty seat, her brown eyes briefly lock with Valentin's blue ones behind his wire-rimmed glasses, and for a moment that feels eternal, she doesn't look away.\",\n",

Resolution: As class ends and students file out, Valentin gathers his courage to introduce himself, but Polina has already disappeared into the crowd. He's left holding his breath, replaying that moment of eye contact and wondering if he imagined the small smile that seemed meant just for him.

She asks if he can explain the previous week's probability theory assignment, claiming she missed some key points.

Rising Action: Polina arrives fashionably late, her gothic aesthetic somehow perfectly suited to the library's ancient wooden shelves and dim lighting. She's carrying a worn leather satchel and a thermos of something that smells like chai spices.

Just as he gathers the courage to lean down and kiss her, they're startled by a group of loud students passing by, breaking the spell and leaving them both slightly breathless and uncertain. Resolution: They continue walking home in charged silence, and when they reach Polina's building, she hesitates at her door before telling Valentin that timing isn't always perfect, but some things are worth waiting for. He spends the entire night replaying her words and wondering if she was talking about their almost-kiss or something larger about their relationship's trajectory.\"\n",

Valentin feels nervous about attending something so specifically tied to Polina's heritage, worried he might seem out of place or culturally insensitive. Rising Action: The event takes place in the university's main hall, transformed with traditional decorations, and Valentin is immediately struck by the warmth and vibrancy of Ukrainian culture. Polina, wearing a modern interpretation of traditional dress that makes her look stunning, introduces him to her Ukrainian friends with obvious pride. Climax: When traditional music begins and couples start dancing, Polina asks Valentin to join her despite his protests that he doesn't know the steps, leading to a moment of pure joy as she teaches him to move to rhythms completely different from anything he's experienced.\",\n",

Resolution: As the evening winds down, Polina and Valentin walk home together, and she thanks him for being so open to experiencing her culture. She tells him that watching him dance and laugh with her friends made her realize how much she wants him to be part of her world, a statement that feels like a declaration of intent about their relationship's future.\"\n",

The city transforms into a winter wonderland of lights, mulled wine, and handcrafted goods, providing the perfect romantic backdrop for what has become an undeniably deep connection between them. Rising Action: As they wander through the Christmas market, sharing Glühwein and traditional pastries, Polina reveals that she's been accepted for a summer internship program that could potentially extend her stay in Germany permanently. Valentin's heart leaps at this news, but he struggles with how to express how much her staying would mean to him. Climax: When Polina asks directly whether he thinks she should accept the internship, Valentin realizes this is a moment that requires complete honesty - that his answer might influence a major life decision and that she's asking because his opinion matters to her in a significant way.\",\n",

His confession hangs in the air between them, more vulnerable than anything he's ever shared. Resolution: Polina's response is to tell him that he's been the unexpected gift of her time in Germany - that their connection is exactly what was missing from her life before. As snow begins to fall gently around them, illuminated by the Christmas market's twinkling lights, they finally acknowledge that what's happening between them is love, even if neither has spoken the word aloud yet.\"\n",

Rising Action: In Tübingen's picturesque old town, they climb to the Hohentübingen Castle, where the view over the Neckar valley is breathtaking despite the winter cold. Polina talks about how different her life in Germany has been from her expectations, how Valentin has been the biggest and best surprise. Climax: As they stand together looking out over the valley, Polina turns to Valentin and tells him she's tired of waiting for perfect moments - that sometimes you have to create them yourself - and before he can respond, she reaches up and kisses him softly, finally bridging the gap between friendship and romance.\",\n",

Resolution: They spend the rest of the day in Tübingen holding hands openly, sharing casual kisses, and reveling in the freedom of finally acknowledging their romantic feelings. On the train ride back to Reutlingen, Polina falls asleep with her head on Valentin's shoulder, and he spends the journey watching the countryside pass by while marveling at how his life has completely transformed in just a few months.\"\n",

Rising Action: When Valentin learns about Polina's plans to spend Christmas alone, he struggles with how to handle the situation. His relationship with his parents is cordial but somewhat distant, and he's never brought a girlfriend home before. After several sleepless nights, he decides to invite Polina to join his family for Christmas dinner.

She says yes to all of it: the house, the future, and the unspoken proposal embedded in his grand gesture. Resolution: The book concludes with a flash-forward to five years later, showing Valentin and Polina in their completed home, hosting a dinner party that includes their Ukrainian and German friends, Professor Weber (who performed their wedding ceremony), and Valentin's parents. As Valentin watches Polina laugh with their guests, he reflects on how his life became extraordinary not through dramatic changes but through the simple, revolutionary act of falling in love with the right person.

The story is set in the late 1990s. The young, rather plain Nadja works in an office in New York. The book is told entirely from her perspective. Her overbearing boss, Temple, is both a threat and an attraction to her, because he is very handsome. She cannot leave the job because she needs the money to take care of her sick brother Josi.However, Temple has a darker secret: he has an alternate personality called Darksider. In the middle of the story, she meets a mysterious new co-worker named John. From the moment they meet, it’s clear that they want each other. She flees with him to a love nest in Aspen.The following chapters are written from the perspective of the now unhinged Darksider, who follows Nadja’s and John’s trail. He grows jealous of the spicy things he learns about them. He surprises them during lovemaking.Back to Nadja’s perspective:John reveals that he is an undercover cop and must shoot Darksider. However, he cannot make the death public because he already has other problems with the force—he’s a bad boy.So Nadja and he bury the body.The epilogue takes place in Nadja’s and John’s large house, three years later. They are married. The children—twins, a boy and a girl, with John’s brilliant blue eyes and Nadja’s dark hair—play outside with John while Nadja cooks. She thinks about how much she loves John, how she will keep their dark secret forever, and how it binds them together.\"\n",

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Feel free to read the book. Some part are definitely fun. The covers look great too and the text is almost always faithfully generated. \n",
    "The text quality is okay, but its not really a long book. Increasing the length of the book and stopping repetitions are the most difficult part of this.\n",
    "I have submitted some books to Amazon. However since approving books can take time, I cannot say wether the books are actually bought by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A book can be relatively expensive especially with Claude , where it costs about one dollar. \n",
    "Gemini is significantly cheaper with less then 10 cts per book, especially when using the flash variant.\n",
    "Also generating a book can take a long time, so more the 30 minutes, which can affect rate limits. Also most APIs are not robust enough to atleast not sometimes fail in generating something, so often you must try again and waste ressources.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say that the chances of these books selling are relatively low, but I will try anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also have thought about ways to improve this / make it more profitable. \n",
    "Of course the formatting of the book could be more intricate, but I think this is not a big hinderance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic publishing is something I thought of but since there is no API this is quite cumbersome and is also probably not what Amazon wants to happen. \n",
    "Still maybe I will do it in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "An idea would be to add another node using a Wikipedia or Search Engine Query to embbed some extra knowledge about a city ( perhaps using RAG). This could then be used to write local crime stories , a genre that seems to sell well and could be personalized to most cities and even villages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great strength of this approach is that I can generate books in any language, although quality might vary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall this project was quite useful and I might go back to it later !"
